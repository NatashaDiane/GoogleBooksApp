# GoogleBooksApp 📚

A fully functional Android application for book lovers out there, like me!

Application characteristics:
 - Integrates with GoogleBooks API to get information about different kind of books depending on what the user searches for by title or by author's name. 
 - Favorite books can be saved under "My Favorites".
 - The user is able to easily buy the book via the “buy” button, which redirects to GooglePlay. 
 - Furthermore, the “preview” button redirects you to the Google Books page. 

Technologies used are: 
 - Java
 - Android’s built-in database called SQLite
 - Android’s Volley Library- an HTTP library for Android application’s that makes fetching data from the internet easier and faster.
